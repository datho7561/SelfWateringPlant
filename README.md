sensor, and to report data on the plant back to the user.

### Author:

### Dependancies:
The Adafruit MCP3008 library, available
[here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_MCP3008).

Built for the Raspberry Pi Model 1B revision 2.

Tested and functioning in Python 2.7.
However, with a slight modification and access to the Python 3 variation of the required Adafruit library, should theoretically work in Python 3.
